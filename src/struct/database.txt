Structures aggregate a set of values into a single entity. 
Unlike arrays, the elements of a structure or union may have different types. 
You can have any data type inside a structure, e.g. pointer, arrays.
You can pass them to and return them from functions.

structures are usually defined before the main function
For example:
struct struct_name {
	type_1 name_1;
	…;
	type_n name_n ; 
};

struct book {
	char title[100];
	int year;
	float price;
} book_1;
then you can access book_1's price by book_1.price.

here are some methods to initialize the struct
 strcpy (book_1.title, "programming"};
 book_1.year = 2010;
struct book book_1 = {"Literature", 2010,10.85}; //in this method, as with arrays, any unassigned fields are given the value 0.

use "->", you can use "person_ptr->age" or "(*person_ptr).age".

Similar to printing of structure, comparing can be done by comparing elements individually.
use "((s1.code == s2.code) && (s1.grd == s2.grd))", BUT NOT "s1==s2".

#

Array of structure is a collection of structures, i.e. the same structure type.
eg:
struct letter{
	char up;
	char low;
};

int main(){
struct letter alpha[26];
for( int i=0; i<26;i++){
	alpha[i].up=...;
	alpha[i].low=...;
	...
	}
}
