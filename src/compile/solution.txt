#how#NONE#NONE#
A program can consists of multiple source files. Multiple files in one program should be compiled together. 
For example, 
gcc filename1.c filename2.c. -o output

To run the program after compiling, enter:
./output


#what#NONE#NONE#
Complier is used to translate high-level language such like C into low-level assembly language.

#why#NONE#NONE#
High-level language like C is human readable language which cannot be understood by machine, we need to translate it into a machine readable language via compiler.

For example, 
gcc filename1.c filename2.c.

#how#use#library#
Gcc provides several commands to using the third party libraries.
gcc -I library name              used to access library in lib, /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib
gcc -L the path of library      used to access library not in above folder

#NONE#use#library#
Gcc provides several commands to using the third party libraries.
gcc -I library name              used to access library in lib, /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib
gcc -L the path of library      used to access library not in above folder

#how#output#NONE#
Adding command "-o outputName" after the normal command can specify the name of the output file.
For example,
gcc filename.c -o output.o

#how#run#NONE#
GCC command "./name" can be used to run the corresponding program.

#what#output#NONE#
The output file after compiling is an executable file, which can be used to run the program by command "./name"

#NONE#output#NONE#
The output file after compiling is an executable file.

#NONE#NONE#command#
basic command: 
-E       After preprocessing, it stops, and does not compile, assemble or connect.
-S       Compile after the stop, not assembly and connection.
-C       Compiles or assembles source files, but does not connect.
-o       Specify the output file.
