A program can consists of multiple source files. Multiple files in one program should be compiled together. 
For example, 
gcc filename1.c filename2.c. -o output

To run the program after compiling, enter:
./output

Complier is used to translate high-level language such like C into low-level assembly language.

#
20000
High-level language like C is human readable language which cannot be understood by machine, we need to translate it into a machine readable language via compiler.

Gcc provides several commands to using the third party libraries.
gcc -I library name              used to access library in lib, /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib
gcc -L the path of library      used to access library not in above folder

Adding command "-o outputName" after the normal command can specify the name of the output file.
For example,
gcc filename.c -o output.o

GCC command "./name" can be used to run the corresponding program.

The output file after compiling is an executable file, which can be used to run the program by command "./name"

basic command: 
-E       After preprocessing, it stops, and does not compile, assemble or connect.
-S       Compile after the stop, not assembly and connection.
-C       Compiles or assembles source files, but does not connect.
-o       Specify the output file.
