For example,

if (i == 0)
...

you can set 'i' not equal to 0, then program won't enter above if statement

Statements is the sentence that programmers will use it to code. 
For example:
label statement
compound statement
selection statement
iteration statement
jump statement

#

If the program checks the expression whether true or false, this is called condition statement

}
else {

}
You can omit 'else' if necessary

int i = 3;
if (i < 2) {
	i = 1;
}
else {
	i = 2;
}

#

int i = 3;
if (i < 2) {
	i = 1;
}
else {
	i = 2;
}

Control statements can increase efficiency of programs.

#
30004
Continue statement will terminates the current iteration of a loop.
For example, 
int i;
for(i = 1; i < 10; i++){
if(i < 5)
continue;
printf("%d ", i);
}
it will display: 5 6 7 8 9

Continue statement will terminates the current iteration of a loop.

#
10004
Add a continue statement on where you want to skip the current step.

#
10001
Add a break statement on where you want to skip the whole loop.

#
1
Break statement will completely terminates a loop.

#
30001
Break statement will completely terminates a loop.
For example, 
int i; 
for(i = 1; i < 10; i++)
{
        if(i == 5)
               break;
        printf("%d ", i);
}
printf("End = %d\n", i);

it will display: it will 1 2 3 4 End = 5

1)If statement, do it if true
2)if...else...statement, do one or the other
3)switch statement, do 1 of many things

#
30006
1)for loop, do something x times
2)while loop, do something an unknown number of times
3)do...while loop, variation of while loop
4) All loops have a when they stop

#
30007
Label statement is used with jump statement "goto"

#
30011
Jump statement is to jump to any instruction with corresponding label

#
30009
Compound statement is to use multiple condition statement together

#
30010
Iteration statement usually is for, while loop
