#NONE#character#string#
The string is an array of character ended with '/0' character

#NONE#float#double#
1)Represents different data types
One is single precision floating point, the other is double precision floating point
2)Single precision floating point significant digits guarantee 6 bits, part 7 bits
Double precision floating point significant digits guarantee 15 bits, part 16 bits.
3)Range of single precision floating point: -3.40e +38 ~ +3.40E+38
Range of double precision floating point: -1.79e +308 ~ +1.79E+308

#NONE#printf#scanf#
The printf() function outputs characters to the console, and the scanf() function reads the user's input.

#NONE#fgets#fgetc#

#NONE#fputs#fputc#
The fputs() function outputs a string to the file
The fputc() function is to enter a single character into a file

#NONE#text#binary#
The text file contains ASCII codes only, whereas binary file can contain non-ASCII characters, such as image, audio, video, executable, etc.

#NONE#array#pointer#
Actually, the name of array can be used as a pointer

#NONE#function#pointer#
Actually, the name of function can be used as a pointer

#NONE#recursion#loop#
1)A loop is a piece of code that does the same thing over and over again when certain conditions are met.Recursion is a function call itself.
2)The loop itself takes up a fixed amount of memory, and the recursion takes up new memory each time it recurses.

#NONE#recursion#iteration#
Iteration applies loop or iterator. It stops when condition fails, such like while, for loop.
Generally, function applies recursion idea, which means a function calls itself and terminates under base case.

#NONE#variable#data#
Variable has a name, type and value. The variable allows us to store data in program.

#NONE#stack#heap#
Stack often stores function arguments and local variable, memory is allocated by operating system and it will be free automatically.
Heap is often created by programmer. It's responsibility of programmer to allocate and free memory. Generally, allocated memory will be collected after program termination.

#NONE#getchar#scanf#
scanf() is a formatted of reading input from the keyboard.
getchar() reads a single character from the keyboard.

#NONE#list#double#
single linked list links one another in one direction, either 'next' or 'previous'
double linked list links one another in two directions, both 'next' and 'previous' 

#NONE#c#java#
C is Process-Oriented Programming.
java is Object-Oriented Programming.
