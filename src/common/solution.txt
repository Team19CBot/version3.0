#NONE#NONE#fopen#
FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );
Open an exist file or create a new file. 
Filename is the string that the named the file, mode can be one of “r”, “w”, “a”, “r+”, “w+”, “a+”. 
if you are dealing with a binary file, you need to change the mode as “rb”, “wb”, etc.
“r” is to open an exist file and allow to read it.
“w” is to open a file and write from the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, there will be created one.
“a” is to open a file and write something which will add to the file’s end. If the file does not exist, there will be created one.
“r+” is to open an exist file and allow to read and write it.
“w+” is to open a file and write from the beginning of the file, which can read the file too. If the file does not exist, there will be created one.
“a+” is to open a file and write something which will add to the file’s end, it also allows to read the file from beginning. If the file does not exist, there will be created one.
