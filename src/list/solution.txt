A chain of linked elements i.e. nodes. 
Each node contains its data and a pointer to the next node in the chain. 
The value of the pointer field in the last node must be equal to NULL.

#what#NONE#double#
Pointer to next element as with singly linked list. Also pointer to previous element as well. 
Can access previous element just by using previous pointer. 
It is more efficient navigation but more complex algorithms and larger storage requirements.
For example:
/* Node of a doubly linked list */
struct doubly_list {
	int data;
	struct Node* next; // Pointer to next node in DLL
	struct Node* prev ; // Pointer to previous node in DLL
};
