#
14
a*b means a times b
int *p means p is a pointer
*p = 3 means dereference operation

#
15
a/b means a divided by b

#
17
a%b means the remainder of a divided by b

#
16
&d means the memory address of variable d

#
1
a++ means a increases 1
++a means a increases 1

a = 1;
b = a++;
so b is 1, a is 2

a = 1
b = ++a;
so b is 2, a is 2

#
2
a-- means a decreases 1
--a means a decreases 1

a = 1;
b = a--;
so b is 1, a is 0

a = 1;
b = --a;
so b is 0, a is 0

#
3
a += b means a = a + b

#
4
a -= b means a = a - b

#
5
a *= b means a = a * b

#
6
a /= b means a = a/b

#
7
int ** p means p is a pointer points to an int pointer.

#
8
a = b means a is assigned with value of b

#
9
a == b means check whether a, b are equal

#
10
&& means AND

#
11
|| means OR

#
12
a + b means a plus b

#
13
a - b means a minus b
