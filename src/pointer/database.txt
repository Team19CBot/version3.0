A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, that is, the direct address of the memory location. 
You must declare the addresses of other variables before using Pointers to store them. 

#
10000
Example:
int num = 3;
int *p = &num // points to num memory
*p = 4; // then num is 4

#
30100
Any valid data type can be declared as pointer, such like
int    *ip;    /* An integer pointer */
double *dp;    /* A double pointer */
float  *fp;    /* A float pointer */
char   *ch;     /* A character pointer */
It also works for function, struct and array.

#
10200
The name of array is a pointer which points to the first element’s address.
For example,

int *p;
int arr[2] = {1,2};
p = arr;

In fact, you can consider array's name as a pointer, and you can use any pointer operation via the name, such as passing it to a function

#
30200
Every element in the array is a pointer to the same data type.
char * arr [3]; //array of 3 pointers to arrays of characters
Common use i.e. array of strings.

#

NULL is an empty pointer which points to nothing.

#
10300
NULL is an empty pointer which points to nothing.
NULL is usually used to initialize a pointer.
For example,
int *p = NULL;

#
40300
When you initialize a pointer but do not know what pointer points to

#
20300
null pointer provides a strategy when we do not know what pointer points to

#
10400
The format is type_name * pointer_name
int *p = NULL;

#
10500
int *p = NULL;
OR
int *p, a
p = &a
NOTE: Memory address operator is &

Careful!!, If pointer is used without initialization, it can cause segmentation fault. If you dereference a NULL pointer, it can also cause segmentation fault.

A variable name directly references a value, a pointer indirectly references a value.
for example,
int num=50;
int *ptr=&num; //suppose this int stores at position 1002
Variable	Value in it
num		50
&num		1002
ptr		1002
*ptr		50
Besides, Values can be changed. For pointer, the change of value means the change of location (where it is pointing to).

for example,
int num=50;
int *ptr=&num; //suppose this int stores at position 1002

num		50
&num		1002
ptr		1002
*ptr		50

#
30700
To read or write value at a given memory address.
for example,
int x=5;
int *p;
p=&x;
printf("%d\n", *p); //dereference
*p=7; //dereference

#
10700
For example,
int x=5; //constant
int *p;
p=&x;
printf("%d\n", *p); //dereference
*p=7; //dereference

#
10803
pointer can be used to change data, Pointer to constant can NOT be used to change data.
For example:
const int x=5, y=7;
int *p=&x;
const int *py=&y;
*p=8; //this one is ok
*py=9;//this one does not be allowed

#
30900
Prohibits a pointer from changing the value of the variable it points to.
for example: const int *ptr;

#
20900
Prohibits a pointer from changing the value of the variable it points to. 
Useful when trying to catch changes to the value (which you don't want to) at compile time.

#
31000
Prohibits a pointer from pointing to another variable. const Pointer can NOT change where it is pointed to.
For example,
int* const ptr=&i; //need to be initialize when declare

#
21000
Prohibits a pointer from pointing to another variable. 

#
11400
ptr + 1 moves the pointer by one memory space, i.e. according to the data type.
eg: *int_p=*int_p+1;

String literals is usually read only, so you might not be able to modify its content.
eg: char * ptr = "This is text"

eg: char * ptr = "This is text"

eg: char * ptr = "This is text"

#
10005
ptr=ptr+n; //n depends on the size of data type. char is 1 byte, etc.

if want to minus two pointer, only if both point to the same data type, indicates the number of data items between them.
eg:
Suppose ptr1 and ptr2 point to two integer variables store in addresses 1000 and 1040 respectively
(ptr2-ptr1) != (1040-1000) != 40
(ptr2-ptr1) == (40 / 4) == 10 //"-" cannot be replaced by "+"

#
11200
Only if both point to members of the same data structure, you can use "=="," !=", ">","<“,“>="and "<=" to check if two pointers point to the same address.
eg:
if(ptr1 == ptr2) or if(ptr1 != ptr2)

#
11300
use "->", you can use "ptr->age" or "(*ptr).age".

#
10406
For example,
int *p = NULL;

#
10407
For example,
float *p = NULL;

#
10408
For example,
double *p = NULL;

#
10409
For example,
char *p = NULL;
